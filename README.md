# âœ‚ iPad OneNote PDF Cropper ðŸ“„

A file context menu option for your computer that removes the margins from PDF that's exported from a OneNote page. It leaves you with an clean annotated PDF.

## Important Notes

The PDF must be exported using **Microsft Print to PDF on OneNote Windows** or any other **exporter that creates pages**. 
 
This cropper **does NOT work with PDFs exported by iOS**, because iOS will export a large single page PDF.
 
The PDF must've been **inserted into the OneNote on the iPad**, because otherwise the size of each pdf page will be different. PDFs inserted on windows desktop are larger than PDFs inserted on the ipad, which screws up the cropping. (Curse you OneNote for your inconsistent design!!! ðŸ˜ ).

Oh the lengths we have to go to for janky technology... ðŸ˜ž
